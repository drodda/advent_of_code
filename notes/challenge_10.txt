Part 2:

As the problem only contains joltage jumps of 1 and 3 between neighbouring numbers this limits the problem space that needs to be searched.

For a joltage difference of 3 both neighbours are required, as removing either will result in a joltage difference of more than 3.
A number can only be removed if it has a joltage difference of less than 3 between both neighbours. In practice this means only joltage differences of 1 between neighbours. The problem is then to permute which numbers can be removed from consecutive sequences of  joltage difference 1.

For only two consecutive numbers with a joltage difference 1 neither can be removed, as removing either will result in a joltage difference of more than 3 between the numbers on either side. There is only 1 permutation for this combination.
For three consecutive numbers with a joltage difference 1, only the middle can be removed. This means there are 2 permutations for this combination
For four consecutive numbers with a joltage difference 1, either or both of the middle numbers can be removed. This means there are 4 permutations for this combination
For five consecutive numbers with a joltage difference 1, 7 of the middle numbers can be removed.
This pattern is a Tribonacci sequence. 

To calculate the number of permutations for the entire sequence, the difference in joltages were grouped into sequences of 1 and 3. Permutations for a group of n 1's is the nth element in the Tribonacci sequence. Multiply these across all of the groups of 1's in the joltage differences to get the total number of permutations.
